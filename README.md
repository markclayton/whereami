# whereami 
A buddy of mine gave me the task of figuring out how the browser truly grabs your geolocation, and replicate it using a python script. Took me about a day or two but I got it working. It uses nearby wireless access points to send to Google API for wifi-triangulation. Not overly impressive but hey :) 

Also, shoutout to this guy for writing the iwlist which does the scanning and parsing of wireless networks. 

Enjoy!
